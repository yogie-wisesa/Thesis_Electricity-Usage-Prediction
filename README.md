# Thesis_Electricity-Usage-Prediction

This is my undergraduate thesis. I created a machine learning model using CNN-LSTM to learn and predict electricity usage in campus building.
I compared three approach to forecasting which are single variant time series prediction using LSTM, multi variant time series prediction using LSTM with
the addition of weather data, and multi variant time series prediction with CNN-LSTM. CNN is used to extract features from the limited dataset which is only
one year and 11 days.
